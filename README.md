# Data-Structures-Algorithms
Hi, I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and this repository is a collection of the programs I create along with various projects I undertake. 

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:  

Implementing Classic Data Structures Library of Classic Data Structures: Develop libraries for linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs in multiple programming languages. 

Algorithm Visualization Web-Based Tool for Algorithm Visualization: Create an interactive tool to visualize the execution of algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal. 

Dynamic Programming Solutions Detailed Dynamic Programming Problems: Solve and explain a collection of dynamic programming problems, complemented by visual aids. 

Advanced Graph Algorithms Graph Algorithm Implementations: Implement and analyze algorithms like Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, and A* search.

String Matching Algorithms Comparative Study of String Matching Algorithms: Implement and compare algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp, and Boyer-Moore. 

Parallel Algorithms Parallel Algorithm Development: Develop and benchmark parallel versions of common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and matrix multiplication. 

Heuristic Algorithms Optimization with Heuristic Algorithms: Implement genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and other heuristic algorithms for optimization problems. 

Data Structure Libraries Optimized Data Structure Libraries: Create collections of data structure libraries tailored for various use cases, including real-time systems and large-scale data processing.

Algorithm Benchmarking Framework: Develop a framework for benchmarking the performance of different algorithms on diverse datasets.
